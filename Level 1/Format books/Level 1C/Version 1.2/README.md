## Sample product
A Level 1C product sample is provided below as a resource referenced throughout this document. This is a Landsat-9 OLI sensor *FarEarth* Level 1C product. 

**Sample:** [LANDSAT-9_OLI_20220804T083603_20220804T083634_L1C_R1C1.zip](https://stfarearth3b2cstatic.blob.core.windows.net/product-samples/products/v1.2/L1C/LANDSAT-9_OLI_20220804T083603_20220804T083634_L1C_R1C1.zip)

## Product data files

A Level 1C product produced by *FarEarth* is a Cloud Optimised GeoTIFF (COG) with embedded geospatial data. This allows you to open the product file in 3rd party tools. The COG file will automatically show at the correct geolocation on the Earth.

Bands of similar dimensions are grouped together in the COG file. Bands in this file appear in the same order as in the band section of the metadata file. LZW compression and a block size of 512 are used. Level 1C products by default use a data format of Int16 and a no data value of -9999.

The scale of the pixel values is given in the radiometric section of the metadata file. 

### Data format and units
The following Level 1C product data options are available and are dependent on the workflow and satellite.

| Role                                           | Asset description                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| digital numbers                                | Pixel values in digital numbers as acquired by the sensor. Values have not been scaled to any units                                                                                                                      |
| radiance                                       | Pixel values in radiance. Images in radiance have absolute radiometric calibration applied to their digital numbers. The value of each pixel is in units of watts per square meter per steradian, in $\frac{W}{m\\^2sr}$ |
| Top of Atmosphere Reflectance ($\times 10,000$) | The value of the pixels is the ratio of radiation reflected to the incident solar radiation, that is measured by a sensor above the atmosphere multiplied by $10\\^4$. The Values are unitless.                          |

### Pixel nesting
Pixels can be nested in two ways depending on the configuration of the processors.

 1. Point nesting
	 * Ensures that the centre point of each pixel in a lower-resolution image is aligned with the centre point of a corresponding pixel in the higher-resolution image
     * This means that that bounding box of the images will not match.
2. Area nesting
	* Ensures that the top-left pixel of the lowest resolution image aligns with the top-left corner of the corresponding pixels in higher resolution images
	* The bounding box of all images in the product will match.

Images processed by *FarEarth* from satellites with similar resolutions and projections over the same areas will have pixels that nest.

### Level 1C Thumbnail File
A thumbnail file is a low-resolution version of the actual product image. It is a small file meant to give you an overview of the product without the need to download the full data. A *FarEarth* product will contain at least one thumbnail. Multiple thumbnails may be included for to show different band combinations, masks or other information. Thumbnails may have different file types.

Products may also include overview, visual or graphic assets that provide similar benefits but have a different format and are more specific to an aspect of the product.

**Sample:** [LANDSAT-9_OLI_20220804T083603_20220804T083634_L1C_R1C1_RGB.png](https://stfarearth3b2cstatic.blob.core.windows.net/product-samples/products/v1.2/L1C/LANDSAT-9_OLI_20220804T083603_20220804T083634_L1C_R1C1/LANDSAT-9_OLI_20220804T083603_20220804T083634_L1C_R1C1_RGB.png)

### Angle image files
Viewing angle and solar angle data is also provided in `.tif` data files. It contains the same information as Section 4.2  Viewing angle metadata file. This data is geolocated to the same projection as the image. This file may be stacked on the image data to process it further.  

Two types of containing angle data are provided in the viewing angle image folder:

#### Solar angle
A single solar angle file is provided. The extent of this image may exceed the dimensions of the processed image. Data is encoded in the following bands:
| Band                  | Meaning                                                                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Band 1: Solar zenith  | Solar zenith values where the scene is subdivided in a grid of averaged values.  |
| Band 2: Solar azimuth | Solar azimuth values where the scene is subdivided in a grid of averaged values. |

#### View angle
A view angle file is provided for each band that is processed. Data is encoded in the following bands:
| Band                           | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Band 1: View incidence zenith  | The angle between the vertical (normal) to the intercepting surface at the centre point of the image or block and the line of sight back to the satellite. Measured in degrees ($0°-90°$). |
| Band 2: View incidence azimuth | The angle measured from the sub-satellite point (point on the ground below the platform) between the scene center and true north. Measured clockwise from north in degrees ($0°- 360°$).                                         |

### Geometric Verification files

The geometric verification files are produced as quality assessment files for every image. Two variants of the files are available, absolute and relative:

* **Absolute products** compare a specific band of the image with reference data and contain the measured geometric error of tiepoints found on the image

* **Relative products** compare bands of the image and contain the measured geometric error of tiepoints found on the image

The comparison between a specific band of an image and a reference image, and between the two bands of an image, is performed in the same way. Tiepoints are collected for both. These tiepoints are independent of the tiepoints collected to process the image. The tiepoints between the reference and the image are matched to find similar ones. The distance between the geolocation of the tiepoints on the reference image and the tiepoints on the processed image is measured.

#### Geometric verification absolute thumbnail
The geometric verification thumbnail that is produced by *FarEarth* is a visual indication of the tiepoints that were matched as part of the process above. The colour of the points indicates the difference between the reference and image in pixels at the GSD of the image.

**Sample:** [GVER_ABS_RED.png](https://stfarearth3b2cstatic.blob.core.windows.net/product-samples/products/v1.2/L1C/LANDSAT-9_OLI_20220804T083603_20220804T083634_L1C_R1C1/GVER_ABS_RED.png)

#### Geometric verification relative thumbnail
The relative geometric verification thumbnails that are produced by *FarEarth* is a visual indication of the tiepoints that were matched as part of the process above between the bands of the image. The colour of the points indicates the difference between the reference and image in pixels at the GSD of the image. These thumbnails are compressed into an archive before being included in the product.

**Sample:** [GVER_REL_BLUE_GREEN.png](https://stfarearth3b2cstatic.blob.core.windows.net/product-samples/products/v1.2/L1C/LANDSAT-9_OLI_20220804T083603_20220804T083634_L1C_R1C1/LANDSAT-9_OLI_20220804T083603_20220804T083634_L1C_R1C1_GVER_REL/GVER_REL_BLUE_GREEN.png)

#### Interpreting the Geometric verification thumbnails

The geometric verification thumbnails are used to determine the quality of the processed image.

An accurately processed image will have a uniform distribution of tiepoints across the whole image that have small disparities. The difference in response between the different bands needs to be considered when interpreting the geometric verification results.

For example, typical BLUE and GREEN bands are spectrally very similar when comparing the bands individually but the BLUE and NIR bands are spectrally separated, and less correlation is expected and normal.

Patterns in the disparities generally indicate that there is some satellite movement that is not being accounted for in the processing.

Isolated islands of tiepoints that are different from their surroundings can indicate an inaccurate DEM or inaccurate modelling of the radiometric properties of the sensor.

## Product Quality assessment files
A Level 1C product has one _quality assessment_ file per band listed in the _metadata_ file (Section 4.1  Metadata file). 

 A _quality assessment_ file is an image file containing the quality assessment mask for the band. Each pixel in the mask indicates the quality of the corresponding pixel in the band data. The mask is therefore in the same map projection as the band data. The possible pixel values of the mask are listed in Table 13.

| Value | Meaning                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0     | No special information regarding this pixel                                                                                                                      |
| 1     | The pixel is undersaturated. The value of the pixel is below the minimum threshold of what the sensor is capable of measuring, therefore this pixel is uncertain |
| 2     | The pixel is oversaturated. The value of the pixel is above the maximum threshold of what the sensor is capable of measuring, therefore this pixel is uncertain  |


## Metadata files

One or more files containing metadata are created with each *FarEarth* product. These files describe the product and conditions under which the data was acquired.
