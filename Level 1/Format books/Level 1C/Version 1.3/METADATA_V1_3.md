# Level 1C product metadata

## Introduction
This is the main metadata file that describes the product. This file has the extension `.geojson` and is readable by third-party applications. This file is made up of a feature collection with a single feature representing the product properties, including sensor properties. 

Note that only selected properties distinct to *FarEarth* are documented here.

Refer to the [Reference](#reference-product-metadata) for a full breakdown of all the properties in the file.

## Sample file

**Sample** : [LANDSAT-9_OLI_20220804T083603_20220804T083634_L1C_R1C1.geojson](https://stfarearth3b2cstatic.blob.core.windows.net/product-samples/products/v1.3/L1C/LANDSAT-9_OLI_20220804T083603_20220804T083634_L1C_R1C1/LANDSAT-9_OLI_20220804T083603_20220804T083634_L1C_R1C1.geojson)

## Property details
This section contains explanations on specific properties of the product metadata file. All the properties that have been expanded on are listed in the [Reference](#reference-product-metadata) section.

The GeoJSON (`.geojson`) file contains an array of features. 

Each GeoJSON feature contains three objects:
* `type`: Always "Feature"
* `properties`: *FarEarth* products contain a `product` property in the `feature`. See [Product descriptor](#product-descriptor)
* `geometry`: See [Feature geometry](#feature-geometry)

### Feature properties
Each feature has a `properties` object. This section describes the content of this object.

*FarEarth* products contain a `product` property in the `feature`, described below.

### Product descriptor
The `descriptor` section contains general product properties. 

This table details certain properties of the `descriptor` section.

| Property |  Description |  
| --- | ----- |
| `productId` | An identifier for this product. Identifiers do not necessarily need to be unique within the *FarEarth* Catalogue, but it is recommended that the naming scheme be designed in such a way that it is unique |
| `temporalRange`  | A pair of UTC dates and times indicating the start and end of the period when the sensor was capturing pixels | 

### Sensors 

The `sensors` section contains details of each sensor module on the satellite. Each sensor module listed in the *descriptor:sensors* property of the product section has a corresponding entry here.

This table details certain properties of the `sensors` section.

| Property | Description      |
|--------------|----------------------|
|`images` | The images section is an array of grouped bands, known as images in *FarEarth*. You can configure bands to certain groups. Bands with similar GSDs are typically grouped; bands with dissimilar GSDs cannot be grouped. This grouping does not affect the processing; it only affects the generated products. See [Images](#images) |

### Images

| Property | Description      |
|--------------|----------------------|
| `qaMask`| Reference to the image file containing the quality assessment mask for this band image. The pixel values and bit representations are provided : 0 (000) is a normal pixel, 1 (001) is under saturated, 2 (010) is over saturated, 5 (101) is  under saturated and filled and 6 (110) is over saturated and filled. |

### Angles

This table details certain properties of the `angles` section.

| Property | Description      |
|--------------|----------------------|
| `sunAzimuth` | Sun azimuth angle. From the scene centre point on the ground, this is the angle between true north and the sun. Measured clockwise in degrees (0° - 360°)     |
| `sunElevation` | Sun elevation angle. The angle from the tangent of the scene centre point to the sun. Measured from the horizon in degrees (-90° - 90°). Negative values indicate the sun is below the horizon, e.g. sun elevation of -10° means the data was captured during nautical twilight |
| `viewOffNadir` | The angle from the sensor between nadir (straight down) and the scene center. Measured in degrees (0°-90°) |
| `viewIncidence` | The incidence angle is the angle between the vertical (normal) to the intercepting surface and the line of sight back to the satellite at the scene center. Measured in degrees (0°-90°) |
| `viewAzimuth` | Viewing azimuth angle. The angle measured from the sub-satellite point (point on the ground below the platform) between the scene center and true north. Measured clockwise from north in degrees (0°-360°) |

### Geometric

This table details certain properties of the sensors `geometric` section.
| Property | Description      |
|--------------|----------------------|
| `dimensions` | A pair of numbers representing the number of pixels across track and along track respectively |
| `resolution` | The target size of each pixel when projected onto the Earth across track and along track respectively. The along track value may be negative, to reflect the convention of the upper left corner of the image having coordinate `[0, 0]`, while pixel rows are counted from the first row of the sensor. In this case the absolute value of the number is the along track GSD |
| `geometry` | A polygon representing the footprint on the band on Earth. Coordinates are for the projection above |
| `quality` | This property indicates whether a systematic or precision band alignment strategy was followed for the band. See [Orthorectification quality](#orthorectification-quality) below for details |
| `projection` | The geometric projection of this band onto the Earth. EPSG projections are used in the form “EPSG:XXXXX” |

### Orthorectification quality

This table documents the `quality` section under the `sensors` section.
| Property | Description      |
|--------------|----------------------|
| `orthorectification` | The orthorectification type is either **systematic** or **precision**. The orthorectification type of an image is precision if every band has an orthorectification type of precision. |
| `metrics` | Metrics are listed in this property if the orthorectification type is precision. The metrics are identical to the metrics in the pointing files.|

#### Systematic orthorectification
Systematic orthorectification uses calibration coefficients, NavAtt data, and rough reference data such as the mean height above ellipsoid for the image.

#### Precision orthorectification
Precision orthorectification uses tiepoints and reference data to refine the geolocation of the image to higher accuracies. Individual pixels of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) are used to determine precisely where the pixel is.

### Feature geometry 

The geometry section defines the full footprint of the image. It is formatted according to RFC 7946.

This table documents the descriptor section of the sensor.
| Property | Description |
| ------ | ---|
| `type` | The type of shape that is described in the `coordinates` property |
| `coordinates` | A list of (x,y) coordinates forming a closed image outline (with units in the stated projection). |
